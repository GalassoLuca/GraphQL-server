# README

Small comparison with GraphQL with single end poing and API REST

You can start the server with

```
npm start
```

## GraphQL
GraphiQL end point at http://localhost:4000/graphql

## API REST
HTTP GET on http://localhost:4000/api/ to get all the books

HTTP GET on http://localhost:4000/api/:id to get a book from id

HTTP POST on http://localhost:4000/api/:id to update the book's author

## TIPS
I have reproduced, and took inspiration, from the following articles.
